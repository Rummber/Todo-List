# Todo-List
*School Project*

This basic to-do list is a project created for educational purposes. Each task you add includes a checkbox for marking completion. To add a new task, press the 'Add' button or use the 'Enter' key on your keyboard. The 'Clear' button, located next to 'Add,' swiftly removes all entries, providing a clean slate for your new tasks.
